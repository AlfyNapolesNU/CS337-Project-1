# CS337-Project-1

## Basic Project Requirements (for a B)
1. Host(s) (for the entire ceremony)
2. Award Names (Categories)
3. Presenters, mapped to awards*
4. Nominees, mapped to awards*
5. Winners, mapped to awards*
 
_4, 5, 6 --> These will default to using a hardcoded list of the awards to avoid penalizing you for cascading error._

_When mining award names specifically, you cannot hardcode parts of these names in your solution with the only exception of the word "Best."_

_Getting half the nominees for given award considered good performance_

## Additional Goals (for a A)
- either perform exceptionally well on basics
- OR complete 1 or more: 
  - Red carpet – For example, determine who was best dressed, worst dressed, most
discussed, most controversial, or perhaps find pictures of the best and worst
dressed, etc.
  - Humor – For example, what were the best jokes of the night, and who told them?
  - Parties – For example, what parties were people talking about the most? Were
people saying good things, or bad things?
  - Sentiment – What were the most common sentiments used with respect to the
winners, hosts, presenters, performances, and/or nominees?
  - Performances – What were the performances, who were the performers, when did
they happen, and/or what did people have to say about them?
  - Your choice – If you have a cool idea, suggest it to the TA! Ideas that will require the
application of NLP and semantic information are more likely to be approved.

Typical performance on the minimum requirements, plus a well-done additional goal, is likely
to earn an A- or better.
